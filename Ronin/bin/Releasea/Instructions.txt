How to Install:
Unzip the program in a folder of your choosing.(Example - D:\Ronin)
You will use Ronin.exe to start the program always as administrator & it will automatically ask you for updates if there are available ones.
When you run it for the first time if your Windows is not up to date, it may ask you for c++ / .netframework updates, let it update.
If the software fails to run after the updates, make sure that you have Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 x86 installed.
